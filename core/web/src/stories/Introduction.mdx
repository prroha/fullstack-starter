# Fullstack Starter UI Component Library

Welcome to the Fullstack Starter component library documentation. This Storybook contains all the reusable UI components used in the web application.

## Getting Started

### Running Storybook

## Design Principles

### Calming Color Palette

Our color system is based on scientific research about colors that promote calm and reduce eye strain:

- **Blues (195-220 hue)** - Proven to reduce heart rate and promote calm
- **Sage/green undertones** - Associated with nature and restoration
- **Reduced saturation** - Lower chroma values reduce visual stimulation

### Content-First Spacing

Components use a tighter spacing scale (4px base unit) that maximizes screen real estate while maintaining readability and touch-friendliness.

### Accessibility

All components are designed with accessibility in mind:

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant contrast ratios
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly with proper ARIA attributes
- Focus indicators for all interactive elements

## Dark Mode

All components support dark mode. Use the theme toggle in the toolbar to preview components in both light and dark modes.

## Contributing

When adding new components:

1. Create the component in `src/components/`
2. Add a story file in `src/stories/components/[Category]/`
3. Include multiple story variants showing different states
4. Add proper documentation using argTypes and JSDoc comments
